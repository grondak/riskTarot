mystical tarot card illustration, intricate Art Nouveau border with celestial motifs, deep indigo and gold palette, cosmic starfield background, symbolic and archetypal imagery, richly detailed, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.
Card title at bottom: "The Archipelago" — Major Arcana.
Central image: Parallel systems developing independently with rare cross-pollination.
Visual references woven into the scene: isolated populations evolving differently; multiple initiatives progressing in parallel; separate fields occasionally intersecting.
Philosophical mood: "What separate systems am I maintaining?"
Portrait orientation, tarot card proportions (2:3.5), no text except the card title in an elegant serif at the base.
