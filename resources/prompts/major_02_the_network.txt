mystical tarot card illustration, intricate Art Nouveau border with celestial motifs, deep indigo and gold palette, cosmic starfield background, symbolic and archetypal imagery, richly detailed, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.
Card title at bottom: "The Network" — Major Arcana.
Central image: Distributed intelligence emerging from local connections without central control.
Visual references woven into the scene: fungal networks sharing resources between trees; movements organizing without formal leadership; mesh networks routing around damage.
Philosophical mood: "How can influence spread without direct authority?"
