mystical tarot card illustration, intricate Art Nouveau border with celestial motifs, deep indigo and gold palette, cosmic starfield background, symbolic and archetypal imagery, richly detailed, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.
Card title at bottom: "The Stewardship" — Major Arcana.
Central image: Tending systems without controlling - creating conditions for emergence.
Visual references woven into the scene: providing conditions, not forcing growth; enabling teams rather than micromanaging; conservation through habitat protection.
Philosophical mood: "What am I controlling that I should be stewarding?"
Portrait orientation, tarot card proportions (2:3.5), no text except the card title in an elegant serif at the base.
