tarot card illustration, dynamic Art Deco border with chevron motifs, amber and vermillion palette, kinetic energy, motion lines and lightning, dramatic directional lighting, sense of urgency and change.
Card title at bottom: "Three of Events" — Events, card 3.
Central image: Event branching - multiple possible outcomes.
Compositional anchor: three points forming a triangle — stability, redundancy, the first structure.
Scene details drawn from: choice creating different paths; wavefunction collapse to one state; speciation into multiple lineages.
Portrait orientation, tarot card proportions (2:3.5), no text except the card title in an elegant serif at the base.
