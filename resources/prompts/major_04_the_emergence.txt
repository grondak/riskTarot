mystical tarot card illustration, intricate Art Nouveau border with celestial motifs, deep indigo and gold palette, cosmic starfield background, symbolic and archetypal imagery, richly detailed, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.
Card title at bottom: "The Emergence" — Major Arcana.
Central image: Complex order arising from simple interactions - patterns unpredictable from components.
Visual references woven into the scene: consciousness emerging from neurons; desire paths emerging from foot traffic; system behavior emerging from component interactions.
Philosophical mood: "What's trying to emerge beyond my control?"
Portrait orientation, tarot card proportions (2:3.5), no text except the card title in an elegant serif at the base.
